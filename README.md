# CSE423-project

1. Project Overview:

This project is a 2D driving simulator game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game features a player-controlled car that must navigate through a road filled with obstacles and collect power-ups to earn points.

2. Gameplay:

The player controls the car using the 'A' and 'D' keys to move left and right, and the 'W' and 'S' keys to move up and down.
The player must avoid colliding with obstacles on the road, including other cars and trees.
The player can collect power-ups, such as coins and shields, to earn points and gain temporary invincibility.
The game features a scoring system, with points awarded for collecting power-ups and avoiding obstacles.
